# Enhanced ML Pipeline Guide

## Overview

The Enhanced ML Pipeline provides a comprehensive solution for processing all your as-built PDF files and training advanced machine learning models. This system extracts engineering-specific features, processes real-world data, and creates sophisticated ML models for plansheet analysis.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites Check

First, check if your system is ready:

```bash
python run_enhanced_ml_pipeline.py --check-only
```

This will verify:
- All required dependencies are installed
- As-built PDF files are available in `as_built_drawings/` directory

### 2. Run Complete Pipeline

Process all your as-built files and train enhanced models:

```bash
python run_enhanced_ml_pipeline.py
```

This will:
- Process all PDF files in `as_built_drawings/`
- Extract engineering features from images
- Train advanced ML models
- Generate comprehensive reports

## Pipeline Components

**Purpose**: Process all as-built PDF files into training-ready data

**Features**:
- PDF to image conversion with high quality (2x zoom)
- Engineering feature extraction (edges, lines, contours, text regions)
- Project categorization (traffic, ITS, electrical, structural, etc.)
- Metadata extraction and analysis
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

**Output**:
- `enhanced_training_data/images/` - Converted PDF pages as PNG images
- `enhanced_training_data/features/` - Extracted engineering features
- `enhanced_training_data/metadata/` - Project metadata and analysis
- `enhanced_training_data/processing_report.json` - Processing summary

### 2. Enhanced ML Training (`enhanced_ml_training.py`)

**Purpose**: Train advanced ML models using processed engineering data

**Features**:
- Advanced feature engineering (complexity scores, density metrics)
- Multi-output regression models
- Multiple model types (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
- Cross-validation and performance metrics
- Feature importance analysis
- Model persistence and metadata

**Output**:
- `enhanced_models/` - Trained model files (.joblib)
- `enhanced_models/training_metadata.json` - Training configuration
- `enhanced_models/enhanced_training_report.json` - Performance analysis

### 3. Pipeline Runner (`run_enhanced_ml_pipeline.py`)

**Purpose**: Orchestrate the entire pipeline with comprehensive monitoring

**Features**:
- Dependency checking
- Data availability validation
- Step-by-step execution with timeouts
- Comprehensive logging and reporting
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance monitoring

## Advanced Usage

### Skip Processing Step

If you already have processed data and want to retrain models:

```bash
python run_enhanced_ml_pipeline.py --skip-processing
```

### Skip Training Step

If you only want to process data without training:

```bash
python run_enhanced_ml_pipeline.py --skip-training
```

### Individual Scripts

Run components individually for more control:

```bash
# Process data only
python process_all_as_builts.py

# Train models only (requires processed data)
python enhanced_ml_training.py
```
