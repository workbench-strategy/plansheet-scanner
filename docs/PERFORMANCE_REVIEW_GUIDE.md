# Performance Review Perspective Guide

## Overview

The Performance Review perspective is a specialized component of the InterdisciplinaryReviewer that focuses on detecting algorithmic complexity issues, performance bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities in code. This perspective helps identify code patterns that could lead to poor performance at scale.

## Key Features

### 1. Complexity Detection
- **Nested Loops**: Detects O(n²) or worse complexity patterns
- **Quadratic Operations**: Identifies operations that scale poorly with data size
- **Deep Nesting**: Analyzes code structure for excessive indentation levels
- **Recursive Patterns**: Identifies recursive functions without memoization

### 2. Inefficient Operations Detection
- **List Operations**: Detects O(n) operations that could be optimized
- **Search Operations**: Identifies inefficient membership testing
- **Memory-Intensive Operations**: Flags operations that consume excessive memory

### 3. Severity Classification
- **Critical**: O(n³) or worse complexity, multiple nested loops
- **High**: O(n²) complexity, inefficient data structure usage
- **Medium**: O(n log n) complexity, potential optimization opportunities
- **Low**: Minor performance considerations

### 4. Optimization Recommendations
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Suggests more efficient algorithms
- **Data Structure Optimization**: Recommends better data structures
- **Memory Optimization**: Provides memory usage improvement strategies

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### PerformanceReviewer Class
```python
class PerformanceReviewer:
    """Performance-focused code analysis for detecting complexity issues."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.complexity_patterns = {
            'nested_loops': [...],
            'quadratic_operations': [...],
            'inefficient_operations': [...],
            'memory_intensive': [...]
        }
```

#### Key Methods

1. **`review_code(code: str, language: str = 'python') -> ReviewPerspective`**
   - Main entry point for performance analysis
   - Returns comprehensive performance review results

2. **`_analyze_complexity(code: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`**
   - Detects nested loops and quadratic operations
   - Assigns complexity classifications

3. **`_check_inefficient_operations(code: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`**
   - Identifies O(n) operations that could be optimized
   - Provides specific optimization recommendations

4. **`_analyze_time_complexity(code: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`**
   - Analyzes code structure for complexity patterns
   - Detects deep nesting and recursive patterns

5. **`_check_memory_usage(code: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`**
   - Identifies memory-intensive operations
   - Suggests memory optimization strategies

## Detection Patterns

### Nested Loops Detection
```python
'nested_loops': [
    r'for\s+.*:\s*\n.*for\s+.*:',
    r'while\s+.*:\s*\n.*while\s+.*:',
    r'for\s+.*:\s*\n.*while\s+.*:',
    r'while\s+.*:\s*\n.*for\s+.*:'
]
```

### Inefficient Operations Detection
```python
'inefficient_operations': [
    r'\.insert\s*\(\s*0\s*,',  # Insert at beginning - O(n)
    r'\.pop\s*\(\s*0\s*\)',    # Pop from beginning - O(n)
    r'\.remove\s*\(',          # Remove by value - O(n)
    r'\.index\s*\(',           # Find index - O(n)
    r'in\s+list\s*\(',         # Membership in list - O(n)
]
```

### Memory-Intensive Operations Detection
```python
'memory_intensive': [
    r'deepcopy\s*\(',
    r'copy\.deepcopy\s*\(',
    r'pickle\.dumps\s*\(',
    r'json\.dumps\s*\(',
]
```

## Risk Score Integration

### Severity Mapping
- **Critical**: O(n³) or worse complexity
- **High**: O(n²) complexity, multiple inefficient operations
- **Medium**: O(n log n) complexity, single inefficient operations
- **Low**: Minor performance considerations

### Overall Risk Calculation
The performance perspective contributes to the overall risk score calculation:

```python
def _calculate_overall_risk(self, perspectives: Dict[str, ReviewPerspective]) -> float:
    risk_scores = {
        'low': 0.25,
        'medium': 0.5,
        'high': 0.75,
        'critical': 1.0
    }
    
    total_score = 0
    for perspective in perspectives.values():
        total_score += risk_scores.get(perspective.risk_level, 0.5)
    
    return total_score / len(perspectives)
```

## Optimization Recommendations

### Algorithm Optimization
- **Nested Loops**: Suggest vectorized operations, hash maps, or divide-and-conquer algorithms
- **Recursive Functions**: Recommend memoization or iterative approaches
- **Deep Nesting**: Suggest function extraction or early returns

### Data Structure Optimization
- **List Operations**: Recommend `collections.deque` for frequent insertions/deletions
- **Search Operations**: Suggest `set` or `dict` for O(1) lookups
- **Sorting**: Recommend `heapq` for partial sorting operations

### Memory Optimization
- **Large Data Processing**: Suggest streaming or chunked processing
- **Deep Copying**: Recommend shallow copies where possible
- **Serialization**: Suggest incremental processing for large objects

## Usage Examples

### Basic Performance Review
```python
from src.core.interdisciplinary_reviewer import InterdisciplinaryReviewer

reviewer = InterdisciplinaryReviewer()
result = reviewer.perform_review("example.py")

# Access performance-specific findings
performance_perspective = result.perspectives['performance']
for finding in performance_perspective.findings:
    print(f"Performance Issue: {finding['description']}")
    print(f"Recommendation: {finding['recommendation']}")
```

### Standalone Performance Review
```python
from src.core.interdisciplinary_reviewer import PerformanceReviewer

performance_reviewer = PerformanceReviewer()
with open("example.py", "r") as f:
    code = f.read()

perspective = performance_reviewer.review_code(code)
print(f"Risk Level: {perspective.risk_level}")
print(f"Findings: {len(perspective.findings)}")
```

## Integration with InterdisciplinaryReviewer

The Performance Review perspective is automatically included in all interdisciplinary reviews:

```python
def perform_review(self, file_path: str, frameworks: List[str] = None, domain: str = 'general') -> InterdisciplinaryReview:
    # ... other reviews ...
    
    # Performance review
    performance_perspective = self.performance_reviewer.review_code(code)
    perspectives['performance'] = performance_perspective
    
    # ... rest of review process ...
```

## Configuration Options

### Custom Complexity Thresholds
```python
# Modify complexity thresholds in PerformanceReviewer
self.complexity_thresholds = {
    'max_nesting_level': 6,
    'max_function_complexity': 15,
    'max_loop_depth': 3
}
```

### Custom Detection Patterns
```python
# Add custom patterns for specific use cases
self.complexity_patterns['custom_patterns'] = [
    r'your_custom_pattern_here'
]
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Review Performance Findings**: Always address high and critical severity findings
2. **Consider Optimization Impact**: Balance performance improvements with code readability
3. **Test Performance Changes**: Validate that optimizations actually improve performance
4. **Document Complex Algorithms**: Explain why certain complexity is necessary

### For Reviewers
1. **Context Matters**: Consider the specific use case when evaluating performance
2. **False Positives**: Some "inefficient" operations may be appropriate for small datasets
3. **Trade-offs**: Consider the trade-off between performance and other factors
4. **Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact optimizations first

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **False Positives**: Some patterns may be flagged incorrectly
   - Solution: Review the specific context and adjust patterns if needed

2. **Missing Detections**: Some performance issues may not be detected
   - Solution: Add custom patterns for specific use cases

3. **Over-optimization**: Focusing too much on performance can hurt maintainability
   - Solution: Balance performance with code quality and readability

### Debugging Performance Issues

1. **Enable Verbose Logging**: Add logging to track performance analysis
2. **Profile Code**: Use profiling tools to validate findings
3. **Test with Real Data**: Verify performance issues with actual data sizes
4. **Benchmark Optimizations**: Measure the impact of suggested optimizations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML to predict performance issues
2. **Runtime Analysis**: Integrate with runtime profiling tools
3. **Custom Complexity Metrics**: Allow custom complexity calculations
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Include performance benchmarks in recommendations

### Extension Points
1. **Custom Detectors**: Allow custom performance detection logic
2. **Language Support**: Extend to other programming languages
3. **Framework Integration**: Integrate with specific frameworks and libraries
